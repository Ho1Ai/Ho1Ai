- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ho1Ai
- 👀 I’m interested in programming. I am coding sometimes when I feel sad or I'm just bored. Once I wrote a game being sad and bored (I spent 6 month just to write small 2D game, cuz... I was writting this stuff only when I felt sad) 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript and React. Javascript is needed for React, so it would be a great idea to understand it well. I like it, cuz it is a bit similar to C++ (I mean something like "int rewriteTheArray(){...}" is close to "function rewriteTheArray(){...}". I really like this stuff) 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something with React. I have created this stuff just to share my apps. I just wanna be frontend developer, so GitHub is a good place to share my works b4 I found my first job (yeah, I am not a developer yet, but I really wanna be)
- 📫 How to reach me: Discord: RISTAKON. I have no ideas what to add, cuz I don't wanna share my social networks
- 😄 Pronouns: He/She (it doesn't matter, just call me using my nickname. Then you can call me either as a boy or a girl) 
- ⚡ Fun fact: Ima human
- Why I did it: GitHub just asked, lol, no more

So, in case you are here, I wanna add one stuff: here I will drop EVERYTHING. No matter will it be just raw stuff which I wrote when I was learning React or it will be my portfolio works. I just wanna save it here or somewhere else. So, don't check some works. May be I'll add full list of 'em (works, which are not main), but now this list is empty (I haven't added anything. Today is 07/02/2024 (I mean July 2nd, 2024) so it may be updated... and also may be not updated... ugh, I can just forget about this stuff)  

Update on 2025/03/25: Now I am learning different languages. I know Python, so I use it in pre-builds (yeah, if you see pipe (WaxusBS package manager) or smth else which is for Waxus and written in Python, then just know that all these things are just test versions. For example, pipe server will be rewritten in Rust/C++/Java (I guess, I'll choose Rust), pipe client will be rewritten in C, etc.)
